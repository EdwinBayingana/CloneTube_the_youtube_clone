## Scripts to Run

After tapping into this project's directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to open it up in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
Lint errors are displayed in the console and client side (browser) as well.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
Check out the documentation on [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more details.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

Check out the documentation on [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more details.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: Once you `eject`, there's no going back! Make sure you are 100% certain you want to eject.**

In case you are not satisfied with the build tool and configuration settings, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Here's is how it will go down: ejecting will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
